# Granulite

A modern GPU-driven rendering system with a focus on performance, scalability, and minimal CPU overhead.

Key features include:
- GPU-Driven Rendering – scene traversal, culling, and draw dispatch fully on the GPU
- Meshlet Rendering – experimental support for meshlet-based rasterization and compute culling
- Bindless Rendering – bindless access to mesh, texture, and material resources
- GPU Particles – compute-based particle system with full simulation and rendering on GPU
- Designed for future integration with ECS and real-time tools. Built using Vulkan.
